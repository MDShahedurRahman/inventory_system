# Advanced Python MVC Project  
## Inventory & Order Management System (CLI)

A modular **Inventory & Order Management System** built using **Python** and the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architecture.

This project simulates a real-world backend system like a mini e-commerce platform, where you can manage products, customers, orders, stock updates, and sales analytics using a command-line interface.

It is designed as a **portfolio-quality project** to demonstrate clean architecture, layered design, and commit-by-method development.
